## Technology Stack

### Phase 1 Technologies
- **Workflow Engine**: Temporal.io (Docker-based, latest stable)
- **Python SDK**: temporalio (Python client for Temporal)
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI (REST API for signals)
- **Database**: Supabase (workflow state persistence)
- **Containerization**: Docker Compose
- **Testing**: pytest + custom chaos framework

### Dependencies to Install
- [ ] `temporalio` - Temporal Python SDK
- [ ] `supabase-py` - Supabase Python client
- [ ] `fastapi` - Backend API framework
- [ ] `uvicorn` - ASGI server for FastAPI
- [ ] `pydantic` - Data validation
- [ ] `pytest` - Testing framework
- [ ] `python-dotenv` - Environment variable management

## Architecture Decisions Required

### ADR-004: Temporal.io Deployment Strategy
**Question**: How should Temporal Server be deployed for development vs. production?

**Options**:
1. Local Docker only (simple, development-focused)
2. Temporal Cloud (managed, production-ready)
3. Hybrid (Docker local, Cloud production)
4. Self-hosted Kubernetes (complex, full control)

**Decision**: TBD in PLAN Mode

---

### ADR-005: Workflow State Persistence Strategy
**Question**: Where and how should workflow state be persisted?

**Options**:
1. Temporal's internal state only (default, simplest)
2. Explicit Supabase persistence (hybrid, for business context)
3. Dual persistence (redundant, maximum safety)

**Decision**: TBD in PLAN Mode

---

### ADR-006: Worker Deployment Pattern
**Question**: How should workers be organized and deployed?

**Options**:
1. Single monolithic worker (all workflows + activities)
2. Multiple specialized workers (per task queue)
3. Dynamic worker pools (scale based on load)

**Decision**: TBD in PLAN Mode
