## Blockers & Risks

### Active Risks (from Risk Register)
- **R-001**: Supabase setup complexity (Medium probability, High impact)
- **R-002**: Cross-platform script issues (Medium probability, Medium impact)
- **R-003**: Rule file format incompatibility (Low probability, Medium impact)
- **R-004**: pgvector unavailable on free tier (Low probability, High impact)

### Current Blockers
None - Ready to proceed to Creative Mode

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Architecture Approach**: Modular Script System (Alternative 3)
2. **Database Platform**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector + RLS)
3. **Code Hygiene**: 200-line rule enforced from Day 1
4. **Development Workflow**: VAN → PLAN → CREATIVE → VAN QA → BUILD cycle

## Success Indicators

- ✅ Level 4 complexity properly identified
- ✅ Comprehensive architectural planning completed
- ✅ All architectural alternatives evaluated systematically
- ✅ ADRs documented for major decisions
- ✅ Memory Bank fully integrated
- ✅ Clear implementation plan established
- ✅ Risk register created and maintained
