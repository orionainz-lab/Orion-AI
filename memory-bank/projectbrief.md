# Memory Bank: Project Brief

## Project Name
Adaptive AI Integration Platform

## Vision
Build a "Self-Driving Enterprise" platform that transitions from static, deterministic automation (RPA) to dynamic, probabilistic **Agentic AI**. The system acts as a central nervous system, capable of Universal Integration, Adaptive Business Automation, and Strategic Interaction.

## Core Strategy: The "Three Gaps" Solution
1. **The State Gap (Durability):** Agents survive crashes via Temporal.io
2. **The Syntax Gap (Reliability):** AI-generated code validated via AST parsing and Gorilla LLM
3. **The Context Gap (Memory):** Business awareness via Process Intelligence and Permissions-Aware RAG

## Key Differentiators
- Durable execution engine (Temporal.io)
- Cyclic reasoning loops (LangGraph)
- AST-based verification layer
- Permissions-aware RAG with Supabase RLS
- "Matrix UI" for human-in-the-loop governance
