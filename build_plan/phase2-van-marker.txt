Phase 2 VAN Mode: COMPLETE
Status: ✅ Requirements Analyzed
Date: 2026-01-30
Duration: ~30 minutes

Analysis Summary:
- Complexity Level: 4 (Complex System)
- Components: 6 (state, nodes, verifier, workflow, LLM, config)
- Requirements: 10 (6 functional, 4 non-functional)
- Risks: 8 identified (6 technical, 2 dependency)
- Time Estimate: 8-12 hours (based on Phase 1 ROI)
- ADRs Needed: 3 (integration, LLM, verification)

Key Insights:
- LangGraph AS Temporal Workflow (inherit durability)
- Reuse 80% of Phase 1 patterns (chaos, config, workers)
- Target: 95%+ first-attempt code validity
- Chaos testing mandatory (100% pass rate)

Next: VAN QA Mode - Technology Validation
Command: /van qa
Estimated Time: 1-2 hours
