PHASE 3 VAN QA MODE INITIATED
================================================================

PHASE: The Secure Context (Data & RAG)
MODE: VAN QA (Technology Validation)
STATUS: IN PROGRESS
DATE: 2026-01-30

================================================================
OBJECTIVE
================================================================

Validate all Phase 3 technologies BEFORE implementation to:
1. Prevent costly integration failures
2. Verify technology assumptions from ADRs
3. Identify blockers early
4. Measure baseline performance
5. Validate security mechanisms

================================================================
VALIDATION CHECKLIST (6 Critical Tests)
================================================================

- [ ] VAN-QA-1: Supabase pgvector Extension Availability
      Goal: Verify pgvector can be enabled
      Risk: HIGH (blocks entire Phase 3 if unavailable)
      
- [ ] VAN-QA-2: HNSW Index Performance
      Goal: Confirm <100ms query time target achievable
      Risk: MEDIUM (affects RAG responsiveness)
      
- [ ] VAN-QA-3: RLS Policy Enforcement
      Goal: Verify 100% user isolation
      Risk: CRITICAL (security breach if fails)
      
- [ ] VAN-QA-4: Embedding API Integration
      Goal: Validate OpenAI API, measure latency
      Risk: MEDIUM (can fall back to local model)
      
- [ ] VAN-QA-5: Supabase Python Client with RLS
      Goal: Confirm RLS applies to Python client queries
      Risk: HIGH (security vulnerability if fails)
      
- [ ] VAN-QA-6: Process Event Logging
      Goal: Verify events persist from Temporal activities
      Risk: LOW (nice-to-have, not blocking)

================================================================
SUCCESS CRITERIA
================================================================

PASS: 6/6 validations successful → Proceed to BUILD Mode
CONDITIONAL: 5/6 pass, 1 has workaround → Proceed with caveat
FAIL: <5/6 pass OR critical failure → Revise architecture

Critical Tests (must pass):
- VAN-QA-1 (pgvector availability)
- VAN-QA-3 (RLS enforcement)
- VAN-QA-5 (RLS with Python client)

VAN QA MODE: IN PROGRESS
